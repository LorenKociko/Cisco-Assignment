    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The timing was a bit unfortunate, since the next day after receiving the assignment, my family (me included) tested positive to COVID. So that week wasn't the best.</p>
    <p>I worked with technologies I had close to zero experience.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Flask with Jinja2 for the overall backend/frontend
        </li>
        <li>Bootstrap for the styling</li>
        <li>MongoDB for the database</li>
        <li>WTForms for the form validations</li>
        <li>Bcrypt for the password hashing</li>
    </ul>
