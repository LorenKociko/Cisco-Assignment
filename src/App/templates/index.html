<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The timing was a bit unfortunate, my family (me included) got tested positive for COVID the day after receiving the assignment, so it wasn't the easiest week, but thankfully we all recovered without any issue.</p>
<p>I worked with technologies I had close to zero experience. After many tutorials and googling, I think the final result, is decent, but can be improved a lot.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Flask with Jinja2 for the overall backend/frontend.</li>
