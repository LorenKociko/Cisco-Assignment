## Overview
The timing was a bit unfortunate, my family (me included) got tested positive for COVID the day after receiving the assignment, so it wasn't the easiest week, but thankfully we all recovered without any issue.

I worked with technologies I had close to zero experience. After many tutorials and googling, I think the final result, is decent, but can be improved a lot.

### Used: 

- Flask with Jinja2 for the overall backend/frontend.
- Bootstrap 5 for the styling.
- MongoDB for the database.
- WTForms for the form validations.
- Bcrypt for the password hashing.
- Flash for the messages towards the user.
- Piillow for the processing and storing.
